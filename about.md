I am a security enthusiast based out of Copenhagen, Denmark.
For the past 4 years I've been working professionally in the security industry, on both the blue team and now the red team.


I love exploring the internet, and finding web application exploits, and as such I have reported multiple vulnerabilites that I have discovered, to various companies.


To name a few of the more known ones:
- [Microsoft August 2017](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-acknowledgments-online-services-archive?rtc=1#0012)
- [Sony Pre-2018](https://secure.sony.net/hallofthanks.html)
- [Hewlett-Packard](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/1072645/)
- [TV2](https://twitter.com/iGotRootBlog/status/1220045884311986177?s=20)

Besides that I work as a Senior Security Specialist at F-Secure currently, and happily doing so! :-)
