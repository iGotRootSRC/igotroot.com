## iGotRoot Blog


I am a security enthusiast based out of Copenhagen, Denmark.
For the past 7 years I've been working professionally in the security industry, on both the blue team and now the red team.


I love exploring the internet, and finding web application exploits, and as such I have reported multiple vulnerabilites that I have discovered, to various companies.


To name a few of the more known ones:
