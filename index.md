I am a security enthusiast based out of Copenhagen, Denmark.
I've been working professionally on offensive and defensive sides of security for 10+ years, still hungry and eager to learn and experiment.


I love exploring the internet, finding exploits, and as such I have reported multiple vulnerabilites that I have discovered, to various companies.


To name a few of the more known ones:
- [Microsoft August 2017](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/researcher-acknowledgments-online-services-archive?rtc=1#0012)
- [Sony Pre-2018](https://secure.sony.net/hallofthanks.html)
- [Hewlett-Packard](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/1072645/)
